[_] - comparison algorithm need to be build to compare the two phoneme strings
[_] - first of all, just detect witch word is wrong and witch word is right.
[_] - first I'll do if any phoneme is wrong the word is wrong, else right.
[_] - then I'll introduce the threshold limit of 70% but still showing wrong or right.
[_] - then I'll start showing the silabas of phones that the person pronounced wrong. (phones would be easier, silabas I would have to map them to phones probably) 
[_] - then after that start detecting at the phoneme level
